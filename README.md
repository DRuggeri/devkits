I play in many different programming languages and often need to install various dev tools to work with the language. Rather than continuing to install more and more stuff in to my 'hax' box, I find it much easier and cleaner to install stuff into a Docker container and do my work from there.

These dev kits may be useful - or they may not. For the most part, they're customized minimally from the upstream distribution.
